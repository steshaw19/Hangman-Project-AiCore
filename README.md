## Project Description
This project is inspired by the classic Hangman game. The project began with two functions. Function 1 asks the user for an input
and checks that this is alphabetical and a single character. If this is the case, another function runs within the first function that checks if the guess is in the random word generated from a list.

The project uses a Hangman class to organise the code. Within this class, there are atrributes defined for the number of lives a player has, a list of all the letters guessed, the number of letters remaining, and a list of the word with the guessed letters replaced using indexing. Lists are appended after each user input.
