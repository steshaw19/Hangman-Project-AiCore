## Project Description
This project is inspired by the classic Hangman game. The project began with two functions. Function 1 asks the user for an input
and checks that this is alphabetical and a single character. If this is the case, another function runs within the first function that checks if the guess is in the random word generated from a list.

The project uses a Hangman class to organise the code. Within this class, there are atrributes defined for the number of lives a player has, a list of all the letters guessed, the number of letters remaining, and a list of the word with the guessed letters replaced using indexing. Lists are appended after each user input.

## What I have learned
The key areas of learning in this project were the importance of documenting the project - i.e. adding notes to increase
usability, commiting files with suitable messages, and updating the README document as I progressed through the project.
This allowed me to quickly update myself on what I had been doing previously and be able to track changes efficiently and effectively.


The second key learning from this project was the importance of debugging. I did this by trialling the code - adding in
values to see what would happen. With this, I was able to see where I needed to add breaks, but also where the code could be tidied up.
